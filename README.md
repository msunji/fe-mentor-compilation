# Frontend Mentor Solution Compilation
I wanted to get more practice without having to come up with UI designs from scratch each time, so I started doing [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges. After getting a handful of challenges sorted out, I wanted to compile these solutions in one place, and that's how this project came to be.

## Tech Stack
### React and styled-components
This project is bootstrapped with CRA and styled with styled-components.

### Airtable API
I had kept track of all the solutions I'd finished on Airtable, so I decided to just go with the Airtable API to function as a database of sorts. 

### Node.js and Express
