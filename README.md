# Frontend Mentor Solution Compilation
I wanted to get more practice without having to come up with UI designs from scratch each time, so I started doing [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) challenges. I also wanted to compile all my solutions in one place, hence this project.

## Tech Stack
- Airtable API
- Node.js and Express
- React and styled-components
